# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Global-Cancer-Trends

#### Project Overview

This project presents a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a cancer dataset with the objective of understanding data quality, identifying statistical patterns, and generating evidence-based insights. The analysis focuses on demographic variables, cancer categories, and relevant clinical attributes to support downstream analytical or modeling workflows.

#### Scope of Work

- Data inspection and validation
- Assessment of missing, inconsistent, and noisy values
- Statistical profiling of numerical and categorical features
- Univariate and multivariate exploratory analysis
- Visualization-based interpretation of trends and distributions
- Preparation of the dataset for advanced analytics
- Hypothetical testing for deeper analysis

#### Outcome

The notebook delivers a clean and analyzable dataset along with structured insights that highlight key distributions, correlations, and feature behavior. The results provide a foundation for further modeling, reporting, or clinical research applications.

#### Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Matplotlib – Visualization
- Seaborn – Statistical plotting
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment
